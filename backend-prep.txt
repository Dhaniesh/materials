Bit Manipulation

Heap and Priority Queue

Action Plan:
Solve 4–5 problems/day (mostly Hard, some Medium for revision).

Revisit weak areas (e.g., DP or Graphs) and solve targeted problems.

Practice under time constraints (e.g., 30–40 mins per Medium problem).

System Design (2–3 hours/day):
Topics:
Design patterns (e.g., Singleton, Factory for backend)

High-level design (HLD): URL shortener, chat system, e-commerce platform

Low-level design (LLD): Design a rate limiter, logging system

Scalability, reliability, availability (CAP theorem, consistency models)

Grok’s System Design Mode (if available, for iterative learning)

YouTube: Tech Dummies or ByteByteGo

Action Plan:
Practice 1–2 system design problems/week (e.g., design Twitter, WhatsApp).

Draw architecture diagrams and explain trade-offs (e.g., SQL vs. NoSQL).

Learn to break down requirements and estimate capacity (e.g., QPS, storage).

Daily Routine:
3–4 hours: DSA (Hard problems and revision)

2–3 hours: System design practice and theory

1 hour: Review and refine explanations

Week 10–12: Mock Interviews and Polishing
Goal: Simulate interviews, polish resume, and prepare for behavioral rounds.
Data Structures and Algorithms (2–3 hours/day):
Action Plan:
Solve 3–4 problems/day (mix of Medium and Hard).

Revisit bookmarked problems (mistakes or challenging ones).

Practice explaining solutions aloud clearly and concisely.

System Design (2 hours/day):
Action Plan:
Practice 2–3 system design problems/week (e.g., design Instagram, ride-sharing).

Focus on articulating trade-offs and justifying design choices.

Mock system design interviews with peers or platforms like Pramp or DesignGuru.

Mock Interviews (1–2 hours/day):
Resources:
Pramp, Interviewing.io, or LeetCode’s mock interview feature

Pair up with a friend or mentor for peer interviews

Do 1–2 mock interviews/week (coding + system design).

Record yourself to improve clarity and confidence.

Get feedback on problem-solving approach and communication.

Behavioral Interviews (1 hour/day):
Topics:
Leadership principles (e.g., Amazon’s 16 LPs)

Conflict resolution, teamwork, handling failure

STAR method (Situation, Task, Action, Result)

Action Plan:
Prepare 5–7 stories from your experience (e.g., a challenging project, a bug you fixed).

Practice answering common questions: “Tell me about a time you failed,” “Why this company?”

Research company values and align your answers.

Resume and Portfolio (2–3 hours/week):
Update your resume to highlight backend projects, technologies (e.g., Node.js, Spring Boot, Docker), and impact.

Tips for Success
Consistency: Study 6–8 hours/day, balancing coding, theory, and practice.

Track Progress: Use a spreadsheet to log problems solved, topics covered, and weak areas.

Focus on Weaknesses: Spend extra time on topics you struggle with (e.g., DP or system design).

Network: Apply early to companies and use LinkedIn to connect with recruiters.

Stay Healthy: Take breaks, sleep well, and manage stress to stay sharp.

Sample Weekly Schedule
Monday–Friday:
3–4 hours: DSA (solve 5 problems)

2 hours: Backend/System design (theory or project)

1 hour: Review or behavioral prep

Saturday:
4 hours: Mock interview (coding + system design)

2 hours: Revise weak topics

Sunday:
3 hours: Light revision or project work

1 hour: Plan for next week

Final Notes
Apply Early: Start applying to companies in Week 8 to secure interviews by Week 12.

Stay Confident: With 2 YOE, you already have practical backend knowledge—focus on translating it into interview success.

Leverage Grok: Use me to clarify doubts, explain concepts, or simulate mock interviews (e.g., “Explain how to design a URL shortener” or “Solve a LeetCode Medium problem”).
