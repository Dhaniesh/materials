3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters.
Input: s = "abcabcbb" Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

- use two pointers, l, r = 0, 0
- use a set to store occurence
- for every increment: r++, check if s[r] not in set: add to set and update max length
- else: remove elements from left until the set becomes clean (check and remove elements from set), then add right
