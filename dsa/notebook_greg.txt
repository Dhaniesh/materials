HASHMAP
36. Valid Sudoku
- hash for row, col, and for box, use predefined list of box indexes

49. Group Anagrams
- hash every word, use defaultdict and store word

TWO POINTERS

977. Squares of a Sorted Array
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
- two pointer, create new array, fill it from end

42. Trapping Rain Water
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
- two pointer, 2 arrays, leftmx and rightmx, water of a bar = min(l, r) - height_bar


153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
- if mid is greater that last element, right is smaller, else serach in left

33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array
- use m and l, then m, l, and target, same for right

81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II
- use m and l, then m, l, and target, same for right (edge case: l == m == r)

540. Single Element in a Sorted Array
- int: indexes will be in pair if it occurs twice, use this to traverse the array

162. Find Peak Element
- int: edge cases, else use bs
- int2: right and left elements, check index as well

209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum
Input: target = 7, nums = [2,3,1,2,4,3] Output: 2
- sliding window

643. Maximum Average Subarray I
Input: nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3], k = 4
Output: 12.75000
Explanation: Maximum average is (12 - 5 - 6 + 50) / 4 = 51 / 4 = 12.75
- sliding window, do the average when returning

1004. Max Consecutive Ones III
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.
- sliding window, 

3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters
Input: s = "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.
- sliding window, use a set to track the Characters

205. Isomorphic Strings
Input: s = "egg", t = "add" Output: true, Input: s = "badc", t = "baba"
Output: false
- use s->t and t->s mapping, only a single mapping should be valid, if not, it's not an Isomorphic string
